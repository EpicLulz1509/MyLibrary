One key  The constant switching of character povs draws attention to how each character views the world differently and how they all think and react differnetly. The influence of the industrial age in the world is finally felt by the masses and I loved how parallels were drawn between the Cosmere world and the real world. Brandon Sanderson really loves his ideas of revolution oppressive class and how god is not someone that we can always idolise or expect of to do the right thing. The choreography of fight scenes are still just as vivid and beautiful as I remember them to be. I can never get tired of Wax zipping around city curving and gliding around skyscrapers chimneys and balconeys. Especially the last chase scene felt like a high stakes car chase.<br/><br/><blockquote> “Cleaning the wound is often more painful than the cut itself.” </blockquote><br/><br/>The cold open/prologue that the book started with gave such a refreshing view on an inexperienced Wax and a battle hardy Lessie which serves as a direct contrast to the Wax and Marasi duo. Wax not being able to hit a single shot in a roomful of thugs was just really funny considering how insane some of the shots he hits later on are. It really just showed us how Wax evolved throughout all his years in the Roughs. <br/><br/>The first chapter is where we officially meet our villain - Bleeder. Bleeder using feruchemical speed to kill a room full of people really showed the peak prowess of feruchemy, and I feel like Bleeder in general showed what a kandra at peak potential could do. I hope they explore more of kandras and feruchemy in the later books.<br/><br/>The initial twist where the Governer is revealed to be the villain was kindof expected and I had laid down my gaurd for a bit. I was a bit disapointed as there were no twists in the first book as well and I really thought Sanderson had regressed. So naturally when it was revealed that Bleeder was actually Lessie the shock value for me was intense. <br/><br/><blockquote> “Every man had to die. He’d always found it odd that so many died when they were old, as logic said that was the point in their lives when they’d had the most practice not dying.” </blockquote><br/><br/>Wax and Wayne had some amazing character development and I feel like by the end of the book their characters have finally come ripe. The ending with Wax killing Bleeder who he thought was imitating Lessie - but then Bleeder was actually Lessie all the time they were together - and that Harmony had staged everything about them - was perfect. Him coming to terms with that in the last chapter was quite touching as well. Him leaning on Steris for support and a shoulder to cry on was beautiful and nothing could have started this book better. Wayne's character I felt like was done more beautifully, especially his chapter where he went to visit the children of a man he had killed. It shows how under his jovial ways he is actually such a complex character. It tells us that he uses his humour to normally cope or deal with things but never overdoes it. His approach on life - the way he views life as an act where he has to perform was quite enlightening. It shows that he believes he has to put on a performance for everyone else (and himself i think) and is waiting for his show to come to end.<br/><br/>Marasi finally had some character development in this book. I liked that she joined the police force and actively participated is solving crimes and social issues on a larger scale. Her using her allomatic power to sneak up to Set's carriage, subdue the Allomancers and use them in her favour was really good. Sneaking around the Governor's house and finding proof about his corruption is exactly the type of police work I wanted Marasi to do.  Steris on the other hand I felt could have had a better role in this book, she is shoved to the side and ignored while I felt she could be of great use to the plot. She truly felt like a great character on paper that is getting wasted. MeLaan's character I felt was quite fun, I really like how each of the kandra here have such distinctive and unique personalities which are reflected in the bodies they usually consume and in the actions and mannerisms they possess.<br/><br/>In the end I really enjoyed the book, it did feel more grim and dark than the first one but I loved the build up to the revolution of the masses that we got throughout the book. Some parts of it did feel like fluff but I mostly loved it. Wayne's shenanigans and quips never fail to amuse me and I felt like the Wayne+Marasi pairing is perfect, I love all their scenes together and always burst out laughing at their interactions. The way Wax interacts with TenSoon is also quite funny because while TenSoon is like a god to Wax, we know him as Vin's sarcastic wolfhound pet.",,,1,0

The second book felt quite bloated with the political shenanigans but this book was filled with action packed scenes and sudden twists in the story. However one of the drawbacks of this book was definitely the villains and how they are just dropped in out of nowhere. It is the third book, the villain is essentially the same but the villain really has not gotten any decent character development, which seems to be the problem for some of the characters. On the other hand Sanderson again takes his Worldbuilding to a whole new level with introducing new cities and countries and just making them feel very realistic and he really manages to encapsulate how the people of these cities or countries reflect where they are from. The magic system has been expanded upon again and I love how he continues to build upon it and how it integrates with the industrial era and the combination of machine + magic.<br/><br/> <blockquote> “The difference between good and evil men is not found in the acts they are willing to commit—but merely in what name they are willing to commit them in.” </blockquote><br/><br/>Finally in this book we got some beautiful character development for Steris. I was waiting for her character to grow, and boy, I was not disappointed. Steris really just evolved into this unique autistic character that we rarely see so interestingly potrayed in media. Her humour was spot on and blended really well with the crass comedy of Wax and Melaan. Also the way Steris tackles each situation with such a thoughtful and honest approach is really a unique angle that I was not expecting but thoroughly enjoyed. Wax reaffirming and encouraging Steris, especially the scene where Wax join Steris to go over ledgers for some missing clips felt so wholesome. I also just loved how the book started with a crashed grand marriage with an unwilling traumatized Wax and a Steris who just has no idea how love or romance is supposed to work; but ended with them embracing each other under a moonlit night on top of a penthouse looking over the mists and clouds. Steris easily became my favourite character throughout this book, and I wish we got more of her in the previous ones.<br/> <br/>Wayne continues to be the best character of this series. The charade of emotions that he went through was written and shown mainly through third person povs and really wish we got more insight into his state of mind during those scenes. Even then you can really feel his emotions pouring through the lines and actions he takes truly reflect them. His quips was still the best and his interactions with truly anyone is just comedic, but especially Melaan. Melaan being a gender neutral character in the Mistborn series is shown in her lines and the ways she views human society. I liked how once again the versatility of Kandra is shown with Melaan taking on this aluminium body, having her brain in her thigh, and essentially being a meat shield for all the booby traps. Allik is a character that is introduced as someone who is from another country, and it really shows in his mannerisms and nuances. I loved the relationship between him and Marasi and how they are both just so interested in knowing more about each others cultures and countries. Marasi proving her herself in the last scene with her quick thinking felt refreshing from just seeing Wax and Wayne do everything.<br/><br/> <blockquote> “I learned how much power over a situation you gain when you decide that you don't care what others think of you.” </blockquote><br/><br/>The twists and villains in this book however left much more to desire. Almost all the twists are predictable and quite 'theatrical'. The villains felt quite bland as well. Even the twist with Wax's sister being the villain was a bit expected given how shallow and fake(?) the interactions between her and Wax felt. I relaly wish Wax's uncle Edwarn and his sister Telsin got some better more nuanced character development and growth. They both were severely lacking in that department and it felt like Edwarn never managed to live up to his expectation of this 'big bad political genius'. Overall I still had loads of fun reading this book, and I definitely liked this book much better than the first two books.",,,2,0

The book is set 300 years in the future in a steampunk + cowboy-ish setting with our dashing heroes Wax and Wayne. It is definitely much more light hearted than the first arc but i think that is because the first arc took a really dark gritty problem and tried to solve it by the end, so naturally this arc begins off on a fresher and brighter arc. Honestly the fact that Sanderson wrote an urban fantasy for a world that does not even exist really just goes to show his extraordinary prowess at world building.<br/><br/><blockquote> “You are inexperienced. So was I, once. So is every man. The measure of a person is not how much they have lived. . . It's in how they make us of what life has shown them.” </blockquote><br/><br/>The first positive of this book is that due it being like 50% the size of the Arc 1 book it has smaller cast of main characters who are easy to follow along and get more attention and screen-time for some decent character development (still not as detailed as Elend or Vin or Kelsier tho). All the characters throughout the book are extremely likeable and the relationships between Wax, Wayne and Marasi are the best. The banter between Wax and Wayne is sometimes overdone but mostly it feels natural and humorous. Personally I loved the involvement of Marasi and the way her character develops throughout the book. By the end of the book you really understand why this book is called 'Alloy of Law' through character differences in Wax and Miles. Steris felt like she had all the unique features to be a good character but sadly was sacrificed to the 'Damsel in Distress' problem. Hopefully we get more from here in the next couple of books.<br/><br/><blockquote> “ To be of use in even a single burst of flame and sound is worth more than a lifetime of achieving nothing.” </blockquote><br/><br/>There are no mistborn in this book (such a contrary to the first arc) but honestly I feel like it has given Sanderson just more room to play with. Here we have Twinborn (Feruchemichy + Allomancy) powers which really gives a lot of different fun combinations. Most of our main characters are Twinborn and again Sanderson just excels in the choreography of interactions between all these Twinborn and how each have a different fighting style as per their own Twinborn powers. Just the fact that the concept of magic system here is about metals and is set in an industrial-age steampunk setting, which just elevates the magic system to a whole new level. It really brings together modern inventions and metal powers and way these two things connect and affect each other is really good.<br/><br/> I personally enjoyed the way Wayne used his ability to be a master of disguises and an ingenious trickster. One of the best scenes I enjoyed has to be the part where he swapped between 4 different disguises to get Wax inside the train vault. This type of scenes was what I felt was personally missing from the first arc; as the first arc dealt with a more serious world-ending threat. Wax is not a mistborn but the way he manages to manoeuvre through thin air and fight against multiple hordes of men is really a testament to genius choreography and writing of Sanderson. BTW everyone here takes their metal shaving with whiskey which just makes it feel so much more like a western cowboy.<br/><br/><blockquote> “ If you remove the foundation of trust from a relationship, then what is the point of that relationship?” </blockquote><br/><br/>The star crossed lovers situation between Wax and Marasi was also too good, I was shipping them to get together by the end of the book. Hopefully it develops more in the future books. The relationship between Wax and Miles was also well developed. It really shows how despite the situation you find yourself in and despite the curveballs being pushed towards you; it is the choices you make that really matter. The book is littered with easter eggs and references to the original trilogy, and I believe future books as well. The ending scene with Marsh honestly just sent me into a panic because I thought Marasi was done for but fortunately I was done this time. Marsh did some have redemption to do after doing almost nothing in the first arc so lets see how he ties into all of this.<br/><br/><blockquote> “I was a little busy being shot at.” “Busy? Aw, mate. It doesn’t take any effort at all to get shot at.” </blockquote>",,,1,0

The stories often revolve around intruiging characters such as the brilliant but cold robo-psychologist Sarah Collins and the dry, sarcastic field engineers Gregory Powell and Mike Donovan. Despite it being a collection of short stories, these stories are all related to each other, as they all exist in the same world and follow a chronological order with the main factor separating them is the amount of time that has passed between them wherein humanity makes progress in the field of robotics.<br/><br/>In today's day and age of rapid AI advancements, this book resonated more than ever. It had discussions about the loss of human agency and control; and the laws and regulations governing robots and AI. The book leaves us grappled with questions of moral and legal responsibility - if a robot causes harm, who is to blame? The introduction of AI in each and every single field with minimal human oversight can lead to disastrous decisions being taken leading to unforeseeable consequences. Such decisions if made by a human atleast lets us hold someone accountable for them. However when an AI or a machine will make such decisions, the only entity to blame will be humanity itself.<br/><br/>Each short story introduces us to a new type of robot and the difficulties that have to be overcome to understand the robot and it's actions. Each time humanity makes progress in the field of AI-Robotics and a new robot is introduced it becomes even more difficult to understand the robot. <br/><br/>In one of the initial stories Runaraound we see how a robot is thrown into a conflict where it is forced into a loop of recursive decisions and is unable to come out of it wihout some timely human intervention. A similar problem can be seen in the story Liar! where a mind reading robot (which is understood by no one) feeds each of the humans interacting with it 'white' lies; as by telling the truth that resides in their mind would put the humans into great disarray and mental pain. The robot here has to follow the 3rd law of robotics 'A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.' Thus it is unable to tell the bitter truth. When confronted about how a human would be hurt to be lied to, the robot is unable to make a decision, malfunctions and stops working. <br/> <br/>The three robotic laws are critical to the world and a lot of the stories revolve around these laws contradicting each other and how robots perceive them. However it is these laws and stories that the author use to prove that if a robot is made according to non contradicting laws, it would be better than humans in jobs such as governance and bureaucracy as robots are not susceptible to greed, deceit or bribery. Our protagonist Sarah Collins seems to agree with this logic as shown in the story Evidence. In contrary, in the story Little Lost Robot it is shown how human greed and error leading to making of a robot with changes in the first law can lead to disastrous consequences. In the last story The Evitable Conflict this is again discussed of whether all the decisions for humanity should be handed over to the robots as humanity never had much control over their decisions to begin with. It had Sarah (the human) arguing for total governance and law-keeping by the robots and Byerley (the supposed robot) absolutely horrified by the possibility of humans having no control over their own future. Often times throughout all the stories the robots seems to have more character, personality and empathy for the humans, while the humans often felt flat. This may be due the programming of a robot as per the 3 laws. It felt like a conscious move by the author which I really came to appreciate by the end of the book.<br/><br/>",,,1,0

""Somehow, we'll find it. The balance between whom we wish to be and whom we need to be."" He sighed. ""But for now,"" he said, nodding to the side, ""we simply have to be satisfied with who we are.” </blockquote><br/><br/>The character development that Vin and Elend go through in this book is some of the best I have ever read. The story progresses in a downward trajectory with the world ending but Vin and Elend are like the symbols of hope and positivity throughout this book. The trust that their relationship has is just an aspiration to have. Also the final dance at the ball was so cute; the characters really deserved a break after all the shit they went through.<br/><br/>The plot-twists were so good as well. They were spread out throughout the book and everything connected in the end. Certain stuff like the 16 metals and the Vin's ear-ring were predictable but Sazed being the Hero of Ages was quite a surprise. Also I was expecting more of a Vin+Ruin vs Elend+Preservation showdown in the end with Vin going down with some touching final words not BOTH of the dying!?!?!? But again they died trusting in each other and I dont think it could be better.<br/><br/><blockquote> “I am, unfortunately, the Hero of Ages.” </blockquote><br/><br/>Sazed evolved into my favourite character throughout this book. I loved his progression and growth and just how 'human' he felt. His conversations about the realisation that he actually had emotions of love and how conflicted he is with feeling them is nice welcoming change of pace. We see Sazed get into a depressive slump, process his emotions and thoughts, and then regain belief and faith in things he once held himself true to. Him finding out none of the religions are truly foolproof or have the true answer he was looking for feels like a metaphor for how there is always going to be something beyond our reach. The truth that dawns upon him is that all people need to survive is hope and belief in something not intrinsically religion but rather in some force that everything will be alright.<br/><br/>Spook's character arc felt quite predictable as well. His manufacturing of a godly image in envy over Vin and Kelsier certainly seemed like the kind of thing that Ruin would manipulate. Also dead people popping up in front of you is not strange to anyone here which is jarring for me. I would shit my pants if I saw someone die a couple years ago and then all of a sudden he/she started talking to me. Even then so I liked his storyline of trying to live up to the people you look up to and getting up and fixing your mistakes no matter how bad or late it may seem.<br/><br/>Ultimately it was a great book. It kept me hooked throughout and the characters felt real enough that I can dream about them. The fight scenes between Allomancers are some of the best, with all the beautiful choreography written in a neutral easy to read language. Such details really make the books stand out for me and keep me wanting more and more.<br/><br/><blockquote> “The nature of the world is that when we create something, we often destroy something else in the process.” </blockquote><br/>",,,1,0

Elend: There were books involved.”<br/><br/>This book is the second in it's series and I absolutely loved it. The core cast of characters is better in this book and some of them finally got their time to shine (Straff, OreSour, Sazed, Breeze) as opposed to the first book where quite a few characters felt like mashed together. The action scenes are always just so well written it feels like you are seeing Vin and everyone move in your imagination. The scene of Vin travelling by flipping like 5 horseshoes using IronPulling and SteelPushing at the same time was so good. The narration and world building as well just as amazing as in the book.<br/><br/>The initial like 30% is kindof boring because all the old characters like Clubs, Ham get reintroduced and their backstory is given which is just the same old thing. But after that slowly you see the plot opening up more with multiple plot-lines. Zane gets introduced here as a potential love interest for Vin who wishes to run away with Vin while a voice inside him tells him to kill everyone. The scenes between him and Straff are so gripping and the fact that he never tried to kill him despite Straff thinking otherwise is just funny.<br/><br/>Zane and Vin scenes were fun; we finally got to see more uses of Allomancy. Their last fight was just top tier with OreSour double crossing both Vin and Zane. I did predict OreSour double crossing but I didnt expect him to not die. I wish we got to see some massacres from Zane's POV as well; it would be fun to see the contrast between his and Vin's thinking and thought process. The scenes where  Vin makes the choice between Zane and Elend is also very well done. The differences and similarities between Zane, Elend and Vin are all connected to each other. Vin is similar to Zane as in their background and childhood but both have different ideals. On the other had Vin is like the polar opposite of Elend in terms of background and childhood but their ideals in life match and both care about each other; which is honestly the only thing you need for love. Elend becoming Mistborn in the end did kind of disappoint me a bit but i am expected to see the couple massacre armies hand in hand.<br/><br/>I loved that they killed off Dockson and Clubs; they were pretty useless to plot and it was quite expected. Sazed, Tindwyl and the Darkness plot was really fun and exciting as well. The final reveal and plot twist was really well done, i dont think i was seeing it coming. The character development of Sazed and Tindwyl are so good, I loved watching them evolve as an individual and the final scene of them together has left a hole in my heart. Vin character development as well was top tier. She finally buckled up and accepted that she was going to kill some people to change things around and it was quite refreshing. Anyways loved this book, cant wait to read the next.",,,1,0
68428,"Mistborn: The Final Empire (Mistborn, #1)",Brandon Sanderson,"Sanderson, Brandon",,"=""""","=""9780765311788""",4,4.49,Tor Books,Hardcover,541,2006,2006,2025/03/16,2025/03/15,,,read,"<blockquote> “Our belief is often strongest when it should be weakest. That is the nature of hope.”<br/> </blockquote><br/><br/>Reading through this book just made me feel like a kid reading Harry Potter for the first time. The language and dialogue is all very simple and the vocabulary is just basic but Brandon Sanderson doesnt let it hold him back. His command of the language is truly exquisite and his writing never felt brittle. However I would give the book a 3.5 but goodreads wont let me. If the other books in the series are better I might reconsider.<br/><br/>However the weakest link in the book is definitely the plot progression and the characters development. It is literally as basic of a YA fantasy plot gets. We get our chosen one (Vin), mentor (Kelsier), side-characters most of who do almost nothing (rest of the crew basically) and our token one dimensional villain. We did not even get any backstory or reasoning behind the actions of the actual villain which felt quite disappointing as I was expecting an exchange of words along with the exchange of metals during the last final chapters. The absence of an antagonist in the book was really<br/>frustrating and felt hollow and I feel one would really help drive the plot forward and allow us to explore other characters as well a bit more. The rest of crew (Breeze, Dockson, Marsh, etc) kindof just blended into a single entity (like a mistwraith haha) because none of them had much impact on the plot. One of the exceptions would be Sazed whose character I found extremely interesting. Even though he is a physical computer like the gholas in Dune I found his character to be well moulded. I really loved his conversations with Vin and Kelsier.<br/><br/>The best and strongest part of this book is easily the world-building and the magic system. The class system is fairly simple one with a tale of oppression between the skaa and noblemen but I would say that the show of discrimination and oppression against the skaa is very well shown. The magic system is quite intricate and is detailed down to very basic percentages of alloys. Now the fights between two individuals with such magic systems can often be a bit lacking and boring (like the Grisha Trilogy) but this book is full of them and each one is absolutely filled to the brim with details really making the reader visualise and process each battle through its blows of metal. Such battles coupled with the easy going almost buttery language and dialogue delivery makes the book such a pleasure to read through. Brandon Sanderson really just nailed the wordplay and honestly even scenes of the MC jumping from building top to building top is just very well articulated.<br/><br/>One of the more interesting characters in the book was Elend Venture, and it really felt like he and Kelsier were on two sides of a coin shot at the same direction. Elend Venture is an inexperienced young nobleman who wants to change the world for the better without any bloodshed; but all he does is read books and discuss politics with his friends. Kelsier on the other hand is a skaa Mistborn who has faced the absolute wrath of the Lord Ruler. Like Elend he too wants to change the system but unlike him he is extremely reactionary and very ruthless in his attitude towards the noblemen. Part of it is him enacting revenge against the atrocities he has seen and faced. Elend on the other hand is reluctant to take up any actual action which is honestly quite frustrating. Vin is at the centre of both of them and it is through her that both these characters go through changes in their personalities. Elend falls in love with Vin due to whom he finally takes a stand and joins the revolution in the final part of the book; Kelsier saves him from the Steel Inquisitor moments before his own death; and then Elend ends up (kindof) saving Vin and leads the revolution to victory. Keeping in mind that Kelsier was the one to recognize Vin's potential and save her in the start of the book was a nice touch to end it all.  <br/><br/>The Lord Ruler's passages was really fun at the start of each chapter and I love when writers do this to give multiple perspectives of the world we are diving into. The romance between the characters was something that I would have liked a bit more, but I cant complain.<br/><br/>With Kelsier dead I predict that Vin is gonna discover a new Mistborn that she is going to train; so that we can draw parallels between both couples. Also I think Elend will probably get together with Vin and he will end up tragically dying in the end to save someone; which will in turn lit a fire in Vin and enable her character to develop even further.",,,1,0

The narration is quite orthodox, and it feels like you are reading through scenes of a movie on a script. Each chapter is like 3-4 pages at max which is quite a change from that other books that I usually read and it is quite fun. The cast is very memorable and likable with each having their own area of expertise. The humour as well is quite dry and 'British', and the book is full of it, which is right up my alley.<br/><br/>However I feel like the book fails in the last 20%, there are multiple plotlines that suddenly spring up and divulge from the main murders. It is full of twists, some of which are predictable. However my problem with the book is that I do not like how towards the end of the book as everything felt like it was just rapidly wrapped up. If some of the twists in the end gave us hints throughout the book it would be more interesting. I would really like if we could see more investigating done by Elizabeth but we dont and instead we get monologues of how the crime so and so occured. There really should have been more leads that were followed throughout the book but nevertheless it was still a real page turner and I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The side characters are also pretty good. There is literally no way anyone could really dislike or hate most of the characters even though a lot of them dance around the morally grey line between right and wrong.<br/><br/>Also I now notice that there seems to be more books in the series, which might explain the openish(?) ending and I hope some of my questions that I have right now (What was Elizabeth's job? Why havent they arrested the culprit?), get explained in the next book. <br/>",,,1,0

The development of characters throughout the book was quite well done. I really enjoyed the world-building of the Shu people and it's nobility. We also get some insight into the Fjerda nobility and the plotline there with Nina and Hanne is good but honestly the best part is just the Ravkan empire and how it has to diplomatically manoeuvre through it's war on multiple fronts. <br/><br/> <spoiler><br/>This book in particular I felt focused more on Zoya's story rather than Nikolai's but I still like how both characters are currently going through a similar problem of confronting and dealing with the 'monster within them' and how both of them come terms to it albeit through different ways thanks to their unique personalities. The way Zoya opens up to Nikolai is a sign that she is accepting that the power within her is a part of her now and that she can embrace it.<br/><br/>The Darkling was the worst part of the book. Sure his pov was a bit interesting but he had no involvement in any of the main events of the book, he is literally just a nerfed side character. I said it before but Yuri should have been killed at those sand pits. Same with the Apparat and the fake king they both felt so useless to story they had no use no substance. <br/>Both of these plotline should have been axed so that we got more time for the Nikolai and Kaz Brekkar heist, that was actually fun and I am so disappointed that it was rushed and that we didnt get more dialogue between all of the different characters. Also throughout the book it is mentioned how great and mighty the Fjerda with their parem induced grisha but honestly it really didnt seem like they won any battles at all. <br/></spoiler><br/><br/>The ending was definitely one of the best tho, we got back to back high octane fights and climaxes continuously, i am sad that we didnt get to see more of Nina's corpse controlling powers; such a waste honestly. Nina and Hanne's plot felt a bit predictable but it was fun nevertheless. The romance between all the couples in this book was definitely juicy and although it was predictable from the start anyways. The supporting cast of Mayu, Princess Ehri and Prince Rasmus served their purpose as well with their own unique character arcs. ",,,1,0

I read the Grisha trilogy before this unlike Alina and Mal the main cast here (Nikolai, Zoya and Nina) and the interactions between them is actually quite interesting. The twists in this book are really fun and while some are predictable the book is full of them so I promise you wont get bored of them.  <br/><br/>The interactions between Nikolai and Zoya are quippy and witty and the way their romance develops as the story progresses was such a pleasure to read through. I really like how the author managed to delve into their characters and give us an insight as who are they and why they are the way they are. A lot of the characters are from the grisha trilogy and only some of them are new ones, but even then a lot of the side characters have quite a lot of depth. I really enjoyed the foreshadowing that was shown regarding both of them throughout the book. There is a twist towards the end of the book which I absolutely hated and I feel like could be avoided but oh well, I am just going to ignore it.<br/><br/><spoiler> This book involved some of the saints as actual characters and it was interesting to actually know what their story was and how they became saints. The magic of the grisha is explained in more depth here and I found it interesting to say the least. Saint Lizabeta being susceptible to human emotions and turning against our protagonists was a nice touch and I feel like it was the authors subtle way of telling us that our gods (the people we look up to or the people we aim to be) are not perfect. <br/>I just hate the fact the Darkling came back to life, it should not have happened. Why they did not just leave Yuri buried in the sands or kill him off after this fake priest betrayed them is appalling to me. Bad move Nikolai. I think the Darkling is going be an antagonist the next book and we are going to get his pov but I hope thats not the case.</spoiler><br/><br/>Nina's story in particular was intriguing to me as she went through a lot of trauma over the Six Of Crows duology and I was wondering if it would just be ignored or just be a sub note in her character and actions. But no, it felt extremely well written, especially how all her actions were influenced by it while keeping the core of her character in check.

The concept of martyrdom and how people manipulate stories to build faith and control the masses is discussed here. The undeniable fact is that a lot of the people who have lost everything literally survive on faith to move on and struggle through all their pain. It shows that sometimes all a man needs to live is to have a little faith in god.<br/><br/>Our MC here is on the process of becoming a god/saint (peasant to god in like 1 year has to be a speedrun) and un-suprisingly she doesnt want to give false promises and deliver a false sense of faith to thousands of people but at the same time she has no other option because she needs the help and support of all these people and she cant wage war without them. <br/><br/>A lot of the twists in this book were better done especially regarding our love quadrilateral<br/> (Alina, Mal, Darkling, Nikolai) and we finally get some character growth (and action) for Mal.

The societal differences are not overlooked but I do wish we had more scenes amongst the characters discussing such.  <br/><br/>One of new characters introduced is meant to be charming and sexy like the Darkling (he very much is) with quippy and witty dialogues opposed to the Darkling's melancholy vibes, but with different views and background.
